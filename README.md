# Potato-MVC

An extremely useless MVC skeleton (sort of) application used solely for the purpose of understanding how MVC works in general.
Based on [panique's skeleton mvc](https://github.com/panique/php-mvc).

## Description

Meant as a hands-on project on learning MVC using PHP before diving into a multitude of complex industry frameworks.
Take it as a DIY MVC PHP (so much acronyms) framework as you will.
